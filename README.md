Detectron2 to For custom objects : Detectron2 is a popular PyTorch based modular computer vision model library.
It is the second iteration of [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/), originally written in Caffe2.
The Detectron2 system allows you to plug in custom state of the art computer vision technologies into your workflow.
It supports a number of computer vision research projects and production applications in various AI tech industries.

## Model Zoo and Baselines
It provides a large set of baseline results and trained models available for download in the [Detectron2 Model Zoo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/main/MODEL_ZOO.md).

This repository allows you to try on your own vision applications by replacing the pretarined models mentioned above according to your usecase.
