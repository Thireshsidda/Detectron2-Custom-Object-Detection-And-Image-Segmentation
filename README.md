Detectron2 to For custom objects : Detectron2 is a popular PyTorch based modular computer vision model library.
It is the second iteration of [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/), originally written in Caffe2.
The Detectron2 system allows you to plug in custom state of the art computer vision technologies into your workflow.
It supports a number of computer vision research projects and production applications in various AI tech industries.

## Model Zoo and Baselines
It provides a large set of baseline results and trained models available for download in the [Detectron2 Model Zoo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/main/MODEL_ZOO.md).

This repository allows you to try on your own vision applications by replacing the pretarined models mentioned above according to your usecase.

## Training and inferencing
### 1. Data gathering
First gather the data from the web browser by running the script 'image_downloader.py' with mentioning the query string that refers what kind of data you want to install for your usecase.
```
query_string = "Various type of Vehicles with clear Number plates"

python image_downloader.py
```


### 2. Data labelling
After gathering data, we have to label it which our model should detect and segment. Here I have used a software called labelme to label the instances and get labelled json data file with respect to each image.

Incase if you don't know how to use this software, just go through this page [Labelme](https://datagen.tech/guides/image-annotation/labelme/) you will get how to install and how to use it.

### 3. Data Preparation
After labelled the data we will get a json format file with respect to each image that contains details of labelled coordinates in JSON format. Now we have to convert this labelled data into COCO format for enabling the models to train on this custom data. 

For that first split your data into train, valid, test and pass these to the script 'labelmetococo.py' to convert the images and json details into COCO format.

### 4. Training the model
Then enable the model to train on your data by running the script 'train.py'. This phase results you an artifact in your defined folder that consists model checkpoints and trained weightd of pretrained model.

### 5. Inferencing the model
Using this model checkpoint you can make inference your test dataset images to check how good it performs on unseen data. For that pass your test image or video to the script 'test.py' as input and ckeck your model performance.
